### ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Analysis
Common error patterns:
- Error Code 51000: "Failed to get storage info"
  - This error consistently appears for agents a_z529b97sud1q and a_zx7oyk5w828r
  - Recommended Action: Investigation needed for storage connectivity issues

### üéØ Backup Success Rate by Agent
| Agent ID | Success Rate | Total Attempts |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| a_v9zqvulyfpa3 | 100% | 10 |
| a_ak8jxjyef633 | 100% | 8 |

## üîç Detailed Findings

1. **Backup Frequency**
   - Hourly backups are being performed as scheduled
   - Most successful backups complete within 30-60 seconds
   - No gaps in backup schedule for functioning agents

2. **Critical Concerns**
   - Two agents (a_z529b97sud1q, a_zx7oyk5w828r) showing consistent failures
   - Storage connectivity issues need immediate attention

3. **Compliance Status**
   - Successfully backed up systems maintain consistent hourly recovery points
   - All successful backups have corresponding snapshot IDs for recovery

## üìù Recommendations

1. Immediate investigation of storage connectivity issues for failed agents
2. Review storage infrastructure for potential bottlenecks
3. Consider implementing automated alerts for consecutive backup failures
4. Document resolution steps for Error Code 51000
